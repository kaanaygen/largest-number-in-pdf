# ConductorAI PDF Parser

This repository contains a simple Python script for extracting the largest numeric value from a PDF document.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+** installed on your system. You can check your Python version:

  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```

- **pip** (the Python package installer) should be available.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` includes:
   ```text
   pymupdf
   ```

## Usage

1. **Download the PDF** you want to analyze and place it in the root of the cloned repository. Rename it to `conductorAI.pdf`, or pass its filename as an argument.

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python3 extract_largest_number.py <path/to/your.pdf>
   ```

   For example, if you named your file `conductorAI.pdf`:

   ```bash
   python3 extract_largest_number.py conductorAI.pdf
   ```

3. **Output**
   The script will print the largest literal number found in the document to the console.

## Notes

- The script uses [PyMuPDF (fitz)](https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF/) to extract text from the PDF.
- Ensure the PDF file is not password-protected.
